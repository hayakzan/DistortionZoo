# Summary

An exhibition of various non-linear transformations. The main inspiration comes from Ivan Cohen's ADC '17 talk Fifty Shades of Distortion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIChUOV_0w4

The code is based on the Distortion module from Juan Gil's Audio Effects project at
 https://github.com/juandagilc/Audio-Effects
 
 as well as the code that accompanies the book "Audio Effects: Theory,
 Implementation and Application" by Joshua D. Reiss and Andrew P. McPherson.
